Ancient Greece was a civilization that flourished from around the 8th century BCE to the 6th century CE. It was made up of a collection of city-states, each with its own government and culture, but sharing a common language and religion. Ancient Greece is known for its significant contributions to Western civilization, particularly in the areas of philosophy, literature, art, and science.

Culture: Greek culture was centered around the concept of arête, or excellence, and the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom. The Greeks were known for their love of beauty and art, which can be seen in the many temples and statues that still exist today. Greek mythology played an important role in their culture, with gods and goddesses believed to have control over various aspects of life. The Olympic Gams, held every four years, were a major cultural event, showcasing the physical prowess and athletic excellence of Greek men.

Technology: The Greeks made significant contributions to the fields of mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. They were the first to develop a system of geometry, which they used to design and build their temples and buildings. Greek mathematicians such as Pythagoras, Euclid, and Archimedes made significant discoveries in the areas of geometry, algebra, and calculus. In astronomy, the Greeks were the first to develop a geocentric model of the universe, which placed the Earth at the center. They also made significant advancements in the field of medicine, with Hippocrates, known as the father of modern medicine, developing a system of diagnosis and treatment based on observation and scientific inquiry.

Art: Greek art was known for its realism and attention to detail. The Greeks were known for their sculpture, with marble and bronze statues depicting gods, heroes, and athletes. The Parthenon, a temple in Athens dedicated to the goddess Athena, is considered one of the greatest examples of Greek architecture, with its intricate columns and pediments. Greek pottery was also highly prized, with vases decorated with scenes from mythology and everyday life. The Greeks also developed a style of theater that is still studied and performed today, with famous playwrights such as Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides.

Some of the most famous historical figures of Ancient Greece include:

Alexander the Great, who conquered much of the known world and spread Greek culture throughout the Mediterranean
Socrates, the philosopher who believed in the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom
Plato, Socrates’ student and the founder of the Academy in Athens
Aristotle, Plato’s student and one of the greatest philosophers in history
Homer, the poet who wrote the Iliad and the Odyssey, epic poems that tell the story of the Trojan War and the hero Odysseus.
In conclusion, Ancient Greece was a civilization that made significant contributions to Western civilization. Its culture, technology, and art continue to influence our world today. From the Olympic Games to the Parthenon, the legacy of Ancient Greece can still be seen and appreciated in the modern world.

There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Markdown editor. If you've gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown!

As with the last post about the editor, you'll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we're using.


## Special formatting

As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:

+ ~~strike through~~
+ ==highlight==
+ \*escaped characters\*


## Writing code blocks

There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, `like this`. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:

```
.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```

#### HTML

```html
<li class="ml-1 mr-1">
    <a target="_blank" href="#">
    <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>
    </a>
</li>
```

#### CSS

```css
.highlight .c {
    color: #999988;
    font-style: italic; 
}
.highlight .err {
    color: #a61717;
    background-color: #e3d2d2; 
}
```

#### JS

```js
// alertbar later
$(document).scroll(function () {
    var y = $(this).scrollTop();
    if (y > 280) {
        $('.alertbar').fadeIn();
    } else {
        $('.alertbar').fadeOut();
    }
});
```

#### Python

```python
print("Hello World")
```

#### Ruby

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

#### C

```c
printf("Hello World");
```

## Reference lists

The quick brown jumped over the lazy.

Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.

## Full HTML

Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:

<p><iframe style="width:100%;" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
