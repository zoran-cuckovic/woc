Ancient Rome
Ancient Rome grew from a small village on the bank of the Tiber river, in central Italy, and became the center of an Empire covering the entirety of the Mediterranean and strecthing from Africa to the British Isles. Conventionally, the civilisation of ancient Rome lasted from 753 BCE, year of the legendary foundation of the city, to 476 CE, when its last king was deposed by a Germanic warlord. During its long and varied history, the Roman Empire encompassed vast territories in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. It was a powerful empire with significant contributions to culture, technology, and art, and its legacy continues to influence Western civilization today.

Culture: Roman culture was heavily influenced by the Greeks, and Roman society was divided into distinct social classes. At the top were the patricians, who were wealthy and held political power, and at the bottom were the plebeians, who were mostly farmers and laborers. The Romans were known for their love of entertainment, and the Colosseum, which still stands in Rome today, was used for gladiator battles and other public spectacles. The Romans were also known for their literature, with famous writers such as Virgil, Ovid, and Horace.

Technology: The Romans were skilled engineers and architects, and they built roads, aqueducts, and public buildings that still stand today. They developed an advanced system of water management, with aqueducts that transported water from distant sources to cities and towns. The Roman system of roads, which was developed to facilitate military campaigns, also facilitated trade and commerce, and helped to unify the empire. The Romans were also known for their advanced military technology, including siege engines and armor.

Art: Roman art was heavily influenced by the Greeks, but also developed its own distinctive style. Roman sculpture was often realistic and detailed, and depicted a wide range of subjects, from emperors and generals to everyday people. Roman architecture was grand and imposing, with public buildings such as the Colosseum, the Pantheon, and the Forum serving as symbols of Roman power and achievement. Roman mosaics, which used tiny pieces of colored stone to create intricate designs, were also highly prized.

Some of the most famous historical figures of Ancient Rome include:

Julius Caesar, the military commander who became the first dictator of Rome and helped to establish the Roman Empire
Augustus, Caesar’s adopted son and the first Roman emperor
Cicero, the politician and orator who advocated for the rule of law and republican government
Seneca, the philosopher and statesman who wrote extensively on topics such as ethics, politics, and tragedy
Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor of Rome who helped to establish Christianity as the dominant religion in the empire.
In conclusion, Ancient Rome was a civilization that made significant contributions to Western civilization. Its culture, technology, and art continue to influence our world today, from the grand architecture of public buildings to the complex systems of water management and engineering. The legacy of Ancient Rome can still be seen and appreciated in the modern world, and serves as a reminder of the power and achievements of this great civilization.





The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet. Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter. 

An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll... originated with us”. 

> It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story. 

The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes. 

As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.
