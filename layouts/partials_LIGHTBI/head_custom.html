<!--
If you want to include any custom html just before </head>, put it in /layouts/partials/head_custom.html
Do not put anything in this file - it's only here so that hugo won't throw an error if /layouts/partials/head_custom.html doesn't exist.

<style>
@media screen and (min-width: 769px) {
    /* .post-content is a class which will be present only on single pages 
        and not lists and section pages in Hugo */
    .post-content input[type="checkbox"]:checked ~ label > img {
        transform: scale(1.6);
        cursor: zoom-out;
        position: relative;
        z-index: 999;
    }

    .post-content img.zoomCheck {
        transition: transform 0.15s ease;
        z-index: 999;
        cursor: zoom-in;
    }
