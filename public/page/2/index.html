                    <p>Director Roland Suso Richter&rsquo;s enigmatic psychological thriller (direct to video/DVD) was based upon screenwriter Michael Cooney&rsquo;s own play &ldquo;Point of Death&rdquo; - a title that gave away the film&rsquo;s entire plot twist premise.</p>
<p>As in many similar films, such as Jacob&rsquo;s Ladder (1990), Soul Survivors (2001), and The Butterfly Effect (2004), events and people were thoroughly distorted and confused because the protagonist was at the point of death. The tagline was misleading:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When You Don&rsquo;t Have a Memory, How Can You Remember Who to Trust?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mind-warping film opened with a hospital patient Simon Cable (Ryan Phillippe) awakening in a <!-- raw HTML omitted --> hospital with little knowledge (amnesia perhaps?) of what had happened, and why he was there, etc. He was told by attending Dr. Jeremy Newman (Stephen Rea) that it was July 29, 2002 (Simon thought it was the year 2000 - he was confused - he heard a doctor say 20:00 hours!) and that he had died for two minutes from cardiac arrest following the near-fatal accident &ndash; but he had been revived (&ldquo;You&rsquo;re as good as new&rdquo;).<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Dr. Newman: &ldquo;Simon, this is the 29th of July. The year is 2002. And your wife, whose name is Anna, is waiting outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(The doctor left off four crucial additional words, revealed in the film&rsquo;s ending.) (Spoiler: Simon had died and was not resuscitated!).</p>
<p>A major clue to everything that truly happened was the scene that played next under the credits - hospital staff failed to bring a patient back to life with a defibrillator after a car accident. Chest compressions failed and there was no pulse. A second major clue was provided by hospital orderly Travis (Stephen Graham): <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Everybody dies. No mystery there. But why and how everyone dies. Now, there&rsquo;s a mystery worth solving. Probably the biggest mystery there is.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

                    <blockquote>
<p>I’ve been through fire and water, I tell you! From my earliest pebblehood the wildest things you could imagine have been happening to this world of ours, and I have been right in the midst of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So begins Hallam Hawksworth’s The Strange Adventures of a Pebble. Written in the 1920s, the book was part of a series which also included The Adventures of a Grain of Dust and A Year in the Wonderland of Trees, all of which were supposed to introduce children to the world of Natural Sciences. In each of them, Hawksworth personifies the natural object he is exploring, and using a mixture of folk tales, scientific facts and colloquial, friendly explanations guides the reader through the history of the natural world. It’s a real thrill of a ride, dramatizing the life cycle of supposedly dull things. The Adventures of a Grain of Dust begins even more loudly than Pebble:</p>
<p>I don’t want you to think that I’m boasting, but I do believe I’m one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I’d like to hear about it.
Hallam Hawksworth was the pen-name of teacher Francis Blake Atkinson. He was married to the author Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson, author of the children’s classic Greyfriars Bobby, which was based on the (supposedly) true story of a Scottish dog who spent fourteen years guarding his masters grave. The couple were both committed to education and published a weekly magazine for Chicago high school students called The Little Chronicle, as well as working for Encyclopaedia companies later in life.</p>

                    <p><code>jekyll new &lt;PATH&gt;</code> installs a new Jekyll site at the path specified (relative to current directory). In this case, Jekyll will be installed in a directory called <code>myblog</code>. Here are some additional details:</p>
<ul>
<li>To install the Jekyll site into the directory you&rsquo;re currently in, run <code>jekyll new</code> . If the existing directory isn&rsquo;t empty, you can pass the &ndash;force option with jekyll new . &ndash;force.</li>
<li><code>jekyll new</code> automatically initiates <code>bundle install</code> to install the dependencies required. (If you don&rsquo;t want Bundler to install the gems, use <code>jekyll new myblog --skip-bundle</code>.)</li>
<li>By default, the Jekyll site installed by <code>jekyll new</code> uses a gem-based theme called Minima. With gem-based themes, some of the directories and files are stored in the theme-gem, hidden from your immediate view.</li>
<li>We recommend setting up Jekyll with a gem-based theme but if you want to start with a blank slate, use <code>jekyll new myblog --blank</code></li>
<li>To learn about other parameters you can include with <code>jekyll new</code>, type <code>jekyll new --help</code>.</li>

                    <p>There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Markdown editor. If you&rsquo;ve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown!</p>
<p>As with the last post about the editor, you&rsquo;ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we&rsquo;re using.</p>
<h2 id="special-formatting">Special formatting</h2>
<p>As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><del>strike through</del></li>
<li>==highlight==</li>
<li>*escaped characters*</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="writing-code-blocks">Writing code blocks</h2>
<p>There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, <code>like this</code>. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:</p>

<h2 id="reference-lists">Reference lists</h2>
<p>The quick brown jumped over the lazy.</p>
<p>Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.</p>
<h2 id="full-html">Full HTML</h2>
<p>Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you&rsquo;re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here&rsquo;s a standard YouTube embed code as an example:</p>

                    <p>Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.</p>
<p>Education must also train one for quick, <strong>resolute and effective thinking</strong>. To think incisively and to think for one&rsquo;s self is very difficult.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.</p>
<p>The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?</p>
<p>We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character&ndash;that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.</p>

                    <p>The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet. Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter.</p>
<p>An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.</p>

<p>It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes.</p>
<p>As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original — which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother — is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.</p>
